# Jarvis Virtual Assistant

**Jarvis** is a voice-activated virtual assistant built using Python, integrated with the OpenAI GPT model, Weather API, and News API. It can help users open applications, provide weather updates, play music, retrieve news headlines, and even interact with the OpenAI API to answer general questions.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Jarvis can listen to voice commands and execute tasks accordingly.
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-3.5 for conversational AI and to answer user queries.
- **Weather Information**: Fetches the weather for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **News Updates**: Fetches the latest news headlines via the News API.
- **App Launching**: Can open local apps like Notepad, Chrome, Word, Excel, and PowerPoint.
- **Web Browsing**: Can open websites like Facebook, WhatsApp, GitHub, LinkedIn, and YouTube.
- **Music Playing**: Plays music from the specified music library.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Jarvis responds using speech generated by Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) or pyttsx3.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install requests
pip install openai
pip install gTTS
pip install pygame
```

### Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<ShaikhHamza104>/Jarvis_Virtual_Assistant.git
cd Jarvis_Virtual_Assistant
```

**2. Create and configure secret_key.py:
**
Make sure to create a **secret_key.py** file with the following content:

```bash
# secret_key.py
news_api = "<Your-News-API-Key>"
openai.api_key = "<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>"
weather_api_key = "<Your-Weather-API-Key>"
```

**3. Run the Virtual Assistant:
**
Start the assistant by running:
```bash
python app.py
```

**4.Use Voice Commands:**

Jarvis will activate on specific keywords and can perform tasks such as:

- Open apps (e.g., "open notepad", "open chrome")

- Fetch weather updates (e.g., "What's the weather in London?")

- Retrieve latest news (e.g., "news")

- Use OpenAI for general queries (e.g., "Who won the last World Cup?")

## How It Works

- **1.Speech Recognition**: Jarvis listens for voice commands using the 
**speech_recognition** library.
- **2.Command Processing**: Based on the command received, Jarvis executes tasks such as opening apps, playing music, or fetching data from APIs.
- **3.Text-to-Speech Response**: Jarvis uses pyttsx3 or gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to reply with synthesized speech.

## Built-In Command

- **Local Applications:**
  - **"open notepad"**
  - **"open chrome"**
  - **"open word"**
  - **"open excel"**
  - **"open powerpoint"**
- **Web Browsing:**
  - **"open facebook"**
  - **"open whatsapp"**
  - **"open github"**
  - **"open linkedin"**
  - **"open youtube"**
- **Music Playing:**
  - **stealth** 
  - **march** 
  - **skyfall** 
  - **wolf** 
- **News:**
  - **"news"**
- **Weather:**
  - **"weather"** (followed by the city name)
- **OpenAI Queries:**
  - **Ask general questions, and Jarvis will respond using the OpenAI GPT model.**

## Future Improvements

- Adding support for more apps and websites.
- Implementing a more dynamic music library management system.
- Improving the accuracy of voice recognition.
- Adding a GUI for easier interaction.
