- **Text-to-Speech**: Jarvis responds using speech generated by Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) or pyttsx3.

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install speechrecognition
pip install pyttsx3
pip install requests
pip install openai
pip install gTTS
pip install pygame
pip instll wikipedia
```

### Getting Started

**1. Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<ShaikhHamza104>/Jarvis_Virtual_Assistant.git
cd Jarvis_Virtual_Assistant
```

**2. Create and configure secret_key.py:
**
Make sure to create a **secret_key.py** file with the following content:

```bash
# secret_key.py
news_api = "<Your-News-API-Key>"
openai.api_key = "<Your-OpenAI-API-Key>"
weather_api_key = "<Your-Weather-API-Key>"
```

**3. Run the Virtual Assistant:
**
Start the assistant by running:
```bash
python app.py
```

**4.Use Voice Commands:**

Jarvis will activate on specific keywords and can perform tasks such as:

- Open apps (e.g., "open notepad", "open chrome")

- Fetch weather updates (e.g., "What's the weather in London?")

- Retrieve latest news (e.g., "news")

- Use OpenAI for general queries (e.g., "Who won the last World Cup?")

## How It Works

- **1.Speech Recognition**: Jarvis listens for voice commands using the 
**speech_recognition** library.
- **2.Command Processing**: Based on the command received, Jarvis executes tasks such as opening apps, playing music, or fetching data from APIs.
- **3.Text-to-Speech Response**: Jarvis uses pyttsx3 or gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) to reply with synthesized speech.
